## Headings

In this paper....

### subsection

Some more text... This is **bold** text

My name is **Gaby...**

Use `#` symbols for section titles. Leave a blank line after headings for readability.

\## Section title

\### Subsection title

\#### Smaller heading (more \# = smaller heading)

## Bold and italic text

If you are using `Source`: **text** and *italic*

If you are using `Visual`: Click Format $\rightarrow$ Bold

## Adding figures and links

Find any image and save it as `.png` in your R project.

The figure below shows that...

**How to include figures and links when using `Visual`?**

## Code chuncks

R code chunks are marked with `{r}`. Type the chunk by hand or using keyboard shortcut.

Mac: Command + Option + I

Windows: Ctrl + Alt + I

```{r}
# your R code goes here
# comment
```

## Common chunck options

- eval = FALSE $\rightarrow$ show code, don't run it
- echo = FALSE $\rightarrow$ run code, don't show it
- include = FALSE $\rightarrow$ run code, show nothing
- message = FALSE $\rightarrow$ hide package messages
- warning = FALSE $\rightarrow$ hide warnings

Example:

```{r}
d1 <- 4 + 8
d1
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
d1 <- 4 + 8
d1
```

## Installing packages (run once) and loading library

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse) # Load packages
```

## Create an object

Everything in R is an object, and R is an object-oriented language. An object exists once you assign a value to it.

After an object is created, it appears in the Environment pane. From there, you can use the object in your code (inspect it, manipulate it, change it, or redefine it by assigning it a new value).

```{r}
# Defining an object (<-)
d1 <- 2 + 4
d1
```

## Using built-in datasets in R

```{r}
#data() # list of datasets
data(mtcars) # load mtcars

# create an object
my.data <- mtcars

# Inspect it
head(my.data)
```
