    "text": "Welcome!\n\n\n\nAlt text\n\n\nThis book was created in order to host all of the materials for AREC 493 class.\nSpatial data is increasingly essential for understanding economic activity, policy and development. This course introduces students to the use of R as a Geographic Information System (GIS) for economic analysis. Students will learn core GIS concepts alongside the basics of R programming, with a focus on practical applications in economics. The course closely integrates tidyverse functions with GIS tools to develop efficient and intuitive coding. Topics include spatial data processing, covering the import, management, and manipulation of raster and vector data, as well as visualization of spatial data through maps to identify spatial patterns. By the end, students will have the skills to integrate spatial analysis into economic research, enabling them to work with powerful and flexible tools for investigating real-world economic questions.\nBe aware that the book is currently being written and will be completed by the end of the semester. Let me know if you think any changes are necessary!",

RStudio is divided into four main panes, each showing different information like your code, console, and files.\nThe source pane\nBy default, this pane appears in the upper-left corner. It’s where you can write, run, and save your scripts (your scripts are basically the sets of commands you want R to execute. You can also use this pane to view your datasets (data frames) while working.\nThe R console pane\nThe R Console (usually in the lower-left pane) is where the R “engine” lives. When you run commands here, you’ll see results, warnings, or error messages right away. You can type commands directly in the Console, but unlike scripts, these commands won’t be saved for later, so it’s best for quick tests or checks.\nThe environment pane\nBy default, this pane appears in the upper-right. It’s mainly used to get a quick look at the objects in your R environment during the current session. These objects can include datasets you’ve imported, created, or modified, as well as parameters or vectors and lists you’ve defined. You can click the little arrow next to a data frame to explore its variables.\nPlots, Viewer, Packages, and Help pane\nThe lower-right pane contains several useful tabs. The Plots tab displays your charts, graphs, and maps, while the Viewer tab shows interactive or HTML outputs. The Help tab gives access to R documentation and help files, and the Files tab works like a mini file explorer, letting you open, move, or delete files. Finally, the Packages tab lets you see which R packages are installed, add new ones, update or remove them, and load or unload them for your session.",
